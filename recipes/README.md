# Pygame Recipes

This folder contains a collection of minimal, focused examples ("recipes") for common tasks in Pygame. Each file demonstrates a single technique or feature, making it easy to learn or reference how to accomplish specific things in your own Pygame projects.

## Files in this folder

- **template.py**
  - The base template for all examples. It sets up a Pygame window, event loop, and basic structure. Use this as a starting point for your own scripts.

- **showimage.py**
  - Demonstrates how to load and display an image on the screen using `pygame.image.load()` and `screen.blit()`. Useful for learning how to work with images in Pygame.

- **drawtext.py**
  - Shows how to render and display text on the screen using `pygame.font.SysFont` and `screen.blit()`. Useful for adding labels, scores, or messages to your game.

- **everysecond.py**
  - Demonstrates how to perform an action every second using `pygame.time.get_ticks()`. Prints a message to the console once per second. Great for learning about timers and periodic events.

## How to use these examples

1. Make sure you have Pygame installed: `pip install pygame`
2. Open any `.py` file in this folder to see a specific technique in action.
3. Run the file with `python filename.py` to see the result.
4. Use `template.py` as a starting point for your own experiments.


Feel free to copy, modify, or combine these recipes in your own Pygame projects!
